William Wordsworth: The world is too much with us; late and soon,/Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;/Little we see in Nature that is ours;/We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
William Shakespeare: Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?/Thou art more lovely and more temperate/Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,/And summer's lease hath all too short a date
Robert Frost: Whose woods these are I think I know./His house is in the village though;/He will not see me stopping here/To watch his woods fill up with snow.
